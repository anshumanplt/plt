On an average, it takes us about 24 hours to ship goods out of our warehouses across India. However if the quantities ordered are more than 5 pieces per product per style, it may take longer to process your order. Should this happen, we will keep you informed by email.</p><p>To calculate how much time it will take you to receive your Myaza merchandize, please check delivery time for your pin code using “CHECK DELIVERY” option in the product details page.</p><p>Usually for most of the locations we offer 48 hour delivery*. Add the shipping times to the 24 hour order processing period. Items are only delivered on business days. Apart from Sundays, there are certain holidays throughout the year that are not considered as business days. Deliveries will not happen on these days.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Customs And International Shipping</strong></h4><p>All of Myaza orders are shipped internationally from our warehouses across India to your provided shipping address via Corrier. Due to the nature of international shipping, occasionally a customer may have to pay additional import duties and taxes which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. The large majority of orders will not have to pay any additional fees. However, we are unable to calculate when and how much these infrequent customs duty charges will be levied. In the case where additional customs charges are assessed, you will be responsible for paying these additional fees. To make your shopping experience as seamless as possible, we have arranged with Corrier to customs clear your goods for you and deliver them to your doorstep. If you are presented with an invoice from Corrier for import duties and taxes, you will have to pay Corrier directly at the time of delivery.</p><p>In case of customer refuses to pay the custom duty or any additional import duties, then customer would be liable to bear the shipping charges and amount would be refund after deducting the shipping charges for the particular shipment.</p><p>For more information about shipping and delivery, please see our Shipping FAQs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
